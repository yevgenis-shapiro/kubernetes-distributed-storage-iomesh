## Terraform Module - IOMesh ( Kubernetes )   | ⭐⭐⭐
IOMesh is a Kubernetes-native storage system that manages storage resources within a Kubernetes cluster, automates operations and maintenance, and provides persistent storage, data protection and migration capabilities for data applications such as MySQL, Cassandra, MongoDB and middleware running on Kubernetes.
